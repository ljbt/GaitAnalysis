This project is our Master 1 technical project.
Its purpose is to analyse gait of patients. For this there is a set of videos of persons wearing a special suit, that allows articulation detection.
Thanks to image processing, computer vision and machine learning, the program is able to extract biometric data and expose its (simple) pathological gait diagnosis.

The program requires images from videos, so you have to execute the script folder_and_images.sh:
  $ cd ./learning_images/
  $ chmod +x folder_and_images.sh
  $ ./folder_and_images.sh
